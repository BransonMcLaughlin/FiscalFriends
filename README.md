// This is an app that was made for a project.

  This app is designed to help college kids with their financial goals. This app will keep up with the users income and spending to try and help the user set goals to save more money and reach their desired financial goals.
  It is still in the working stages, but in the future will allow users to add their student debt and also have a function to be able to help the user build their personal credit through the app.
